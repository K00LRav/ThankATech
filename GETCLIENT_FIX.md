# getClient Function Fix - October 1, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed: `getClient is not a function`

### Problem
The dashboard was trying to import `getClient` from firebase.js, but this function didn't exist. The error was:
```
(0 , _lib_firebase__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.getClient) is not a function
```

### Root Cause
The dashboard code was importing `getClient as getUser` but the firebase.js file only had a `getUser` function, not a `getClient` function.

### Solution
1. **Created `getClient` function** in `src/lib/firebase.js`:
   ```javascript
   export async function getClient(clientId) {
     if (!db || !clientId) return null;
     
     try {
       const clientDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, COLLECTIONS.CLIENTS, clientId));
       if (clientDoc.exists()) {
         const clientData = { id: clientDoc.id, ...clientDoc.data() };
         return clientData;
       }
       
       return null;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('‚ùå Error getting client:', error);
       return null;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Updated dashboard imports** in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   // Changed from:
   import { ..., getClient as getUser } from '@/lib/firebase';
   
   // To:
   import { ..., getClient } from '@/lib/firebase';
   ```

3. **Updated function call**:
   ```tsx
   // Changed from:
   userData = await getUser(firebaseUser.uid);
   
   // To:
   userData = await getClient(firebaseUser.uid);
   ```

### Technical Details
- The `getClient` function reads from the `COLLECTIONS.CLIENTS` Firestore collection
- It's functionally identical to `getUser` but with clearer naming for client data
- Both functions return client/user data or null if not found
- Error handling included with console logging

### Result
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Client data fetching works correctly
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between `getClient` (for clients) and `getTechnician` (for technicians)
- ‚úÖ Development server running on localhost:3001

The dashboard should now load properly and be able to fetch client data correctly! üéâ
